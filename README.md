# econometricsFinalLab

This is my final lab assignemnt for Econometrics (220:322 Fall 2020) with Prof. Paczkowski at Rutgers University. I recieved a 20/20 grade on this assignment.

In this lab I identified a unique economic problem, collected data, analyzed data, estimated a multiple linear regresssion model using the pandas library, and finally interpreted regression estimation results.

## Problem Statement

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has announced it's economic stimulus plan in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The CCP has put
in place plans to increase government spending in order to build new and improve existing infrastructure. This plan will stimulate the short
term economy by creating jobs while being able to benefit in the long term, from a more efficient infrastructure after the pandemic is over.
These projects have caused the demand for raw materials (example being construction metals) to increase drastically and has led the prices
for scrap metal to record levels. Global shipping companies, being some of the most devastated companies from the Covid-19 pandemic,
are looking to cash in on these scrap metal prices by selling some of their older and less fuel efficient industrial cargo ships (ships that would
have otherwise continued to sail for much longer periods of times) for a short term injection of cash to hopefully be able to ride out the
remainder of the economic slowdown we have experienced since March of 2020. This may cause a problem for the future global economy,
as we have become so reliant on the merchant marine fleets; "the unsung heroes of globalization". This decrease in shipping capacity may
indicate a slow down in globalization as countries look to become more self sufficient, moving forward after the pandemic. This would then
have huge impacts on the global economy as the productivity and efficiency offered by specializtion will definitely be lessened.

In this lab we look to explore this relationship between global gross domestic product and the total deadweight tons of the global merchant
fleet (totaly shipping capacity) and try to capture the affect total shipping capacity will have on the global economy. To do this we will
estimate a complex regression model that will also take into account world population, global unemployment, global energy consumption,
and world literacy rate.

The idea for this lab is from Economics Explained's most recent Youtube video uploaded on 12/03/2020. Here is a link to the video
